## ✨ What I Did & Learned

Hey there! This project was all about getting my hands dirty with data. I focused on:

* **Cleaning up messy data:** Making sure everything was neat and ready to use.
* **Exploring the data (EDA):** Finding out what's really going on in the numbers.
* **Making awesome charts:** Turning data into easy-to-understand visuals with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* **Pulling out key insights:** Figuring out what the data was actually telling us about restaurants and customers.
* **Getting better with Pandas:** Seriously, Pandas is a superpower for data!
* **[Add any other specific skills or concepts you focused on, e.g., geospatial analysis if you plotted locations.]**
