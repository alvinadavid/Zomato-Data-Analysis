## ‚ú® What I Did & Learned

My work in this project involved a hands-on approach to data analysis:

* **Making data neat and :** Making sure everything was neat and ready to use.
* **Exploring the data (EDA):** Finding out what's really going on in the numbers.
* **Making visualized charts:** Turning data into easy-to-understand visuals with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* **Pulling out key insights:** Figuring out what the data was actually telling us about restaurants and customers.
* **Getting better with Pandas:** Seriously, Pandas is a superpower for data!
